@ dev Returns true if account is a contract . This test is non exhaustive , and there may be false negatives : during the execution of a contract ' s constructor , its address will be reported as not containing a contract . IMPORTANT : It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns false is an externally owned account ( EOA ) and not a contract . This method relies in extcodesize , which returns 0 for contracts in construction , since the code is only stored at the end of the constructor execution . According to EIP 1052 , 0x0 is the value returned for not yet created accounts and 0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470 is returned for accounts without code , i . e . keccak256 ( ' ' ) solhint disable next line no inline assembly

This famous algorithm is called " exponentiation by squaring " and calculates x ^ n with x as fixed point and n as regular unsigned . It ' s O ( log n ) , instead of O ( n ) for naive repeated multiplication . These facts are why it works : If n is even , then x ^ n ( x ^ 2 ) ^ ( n 2 ) . If n is odd , then x ^ n x x ^ ( n 1 ) , and applying the equation for even x gives x ^ n x ( x ^ 2 ) ^ ( ( n 1 ) 2 ) . Also , EVM division is flooring and floor [ ( n 1 ) 2 ] floor [ n 2 ] .

This modifies the order of the array , as noted in { at } . When the value to delete is the last one , the swap operation is unnecessary . However , since this occurs so rarely , we still do the swap anyway to avoid the gas cost of adding an ' if ' statement .

This famous algorithm is called " exponentiation by squaring " and calculates x ^ n with x as fixed point and n as regular unsigned .

@ dev Prevents a contract from calling itself , directly or indirectly . Calling a non Reentrant function from another non Reentrant function is not supported . It is possible to prevent this from happening by making the non Reentrant function external , and make it call a private function that does the actual work .

This famous algorithm is called " exponentiation by squaring " and calculates x ^ n with x as fixed point and n as regular unsigned . It ' s O ( log n ) , instead of O ( n ) for naive repeated multiplication . These facts are why it works : If n is even , then x ^ n ( x ^ 2 ) ^ ( n 2 ) . If n is odd , then x ^ n x x ^ ( n 1 ) , and applying the equation for even x gives x ^ n x ( x ^ 2 ) ^ ( ( n 1 ) 2 ) . Also , EVM division is flooring and floor [ ( n 1 ) 2 ] floor [ n 2 ] .

@ dev Same as { xref Address function Call address bytes } [ function Call ] , but also transferring value wei to target . Requirements : the calling contract must have an ETH balance of at least value . the called Solidity function must be payable . Available since v3 . 1 .
@ dev Imitates a Solidity high level call ( i . e . a regular function call to a contract ) , relaxing the requirement on the return value : the return value is optional ( but if data is returned , it must not be false ) . @ param token The token targeted by the call . @ param data The call data ( encoded using abi . encode or one of its variants ) . We need to perform a low level call here , to bypass Solidity ' s return data size checking mechanism , since we ' re implementing it ourselves . A Solidity high level call has three parts : 1 . The target address is checked to verify it contains contract code 2 . The call itself is made , and success asserted 3 . The return value is decoded , which in turn checks the size of the returned data . solhint disable next line max line length solhint disable next line avoid low level calls if ( returndata . length > 0 ) { solhint disable next line max line length
